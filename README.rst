geeteventbus
============
An eventbus for concurrent programming
--------------------------------------

geeteventbus is a library that allows publish-subscribe-style communication. There is no need for the components to register to each-other. It is inspired by a Java library, Guava eventbus from Google. But it is not exactly same as the Guava eventbus library.

- geeteventbus simplifies handling events from publishers and subscribers.
- publisher and subscribers don't need to create threads to concurrently process the events.
- the eventbus can be synchronus, where the events are delivered from the same thread posting the events
- events can be delivered to subscibers in the same order they are posted
- subscribers may be declared as thread-safe, in that case same subscriber may be invoked concurrently for processing multiple events
- events for which there are no subscribers are registered yet are simply discared by the eventbus.
- the eventbus is not to be used for inter process communication. Publishers and subsribers must run on the same process

Basic working
-------------

1) We create an eventbus

    .. code:: python

        from geeteventbus.eventbus import eventbus
        eb = eventbus()

   This will create an eventbus with the defaults. The default eventbus will have below characteristics:

        1) the maximum queued event limit is set to 10000
        2) number of executor thread is 8
        3) the subscribers will be called asynchronously
        4) subscibers are treated as thread-safe and hence same subscribers may be invoked simultaneously  on different threads
    
2) Create a subsclass of subscriber and override the process method. Create an object of this class and register it to the eventbus for receiving messages with certain topics:
    
    .. code:: python

        from geeteventbus.subscriber import subscriber
        from geeteventbus.eventbus import eventbus
        from geeteventbus.event import event

        class mysubscriber(subscriber):
            def process(self, eventobj):
                if not isinstance(eventobj, event):
                    print('Invalid object type is passed.')
                    return
                topic = eventobj.get_topic()
                data = eventobj.get_data()
                print('Processing event with TOPIC: %s, DATA: %s' % (topic, data))
        
        subscr = mysubscriber()
        eb.register_consumer(subscr, 'an_important_topic')

3) Post some events to the eventbus with the topic "an_important_topic".

    .. code:: python

        from geeteventbus.event import event

        eobj1 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 1')
        eobj2 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 2')
        eobj3 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 3')
        eobj3 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 4')
    
        eb.post(eobj1)
        eb.post(eobj2)
        eb.post(eobj3)
        eb.post(eobj4)

4) We may gracefully shutdown the eventbus before exiting the process

    .. code:: python
        
        eb.shutdown()


The complete example is below:
    
    .. code:: python
        
        from time import sleep
        from geeteventbus.subscriber import subscriber
        from geeteventbus.eventbus import eventbus
        from geeteventbus.event import event

        class mysubscriber(subscriber):
            def process(self, eventobj):
                if not isinstance(eventobj, event):
                    print('Invalid object type is passed.')
                    return
                topic = eventobj.get_topic()
                data = eventobj.get_data()
                print('Processing event with TOPIC: %s, DATA: %s' % (topic, data))
        
        
        eb = eventbus()
        subscr = mysubscriber()
        eb.register_consumer(subscr, 'an_important_topic')
        

        eobj1 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 1')
        eobj2 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 2')
        eobj3 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 3')
        eobj4 = event('an_important_topic', 'This is some data for the event 4')
    
        eb.post(eobj1)
        eb.post(eobj2)
        eb.post(eobj3)
        eb.post(eobj4)

        eb.shutdown()
        sleep(2)


A more detailed example is given below. A subscriber (counter_aggregator) aggregates the values for 
a set of counters. It registers itself to an eventbus for receiving events for the 
counters(topics). A set of producers update the values for the counters and post events describing
the counter to the eventbus:
    
    .. code:: python

        from threading import Lock, Thread
        from time import sleep, time
        from geeteventbus.eventbus import eventbus
        from geeteventbus.event import event
        from geeteventbus.subscriber import subscriber
        from random import randint


        class counter_aggregator(subscriber, Thread):
            '''

            are aggregated by this class and output the aggregated value periodically.
